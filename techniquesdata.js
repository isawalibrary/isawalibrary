effect: "Activation: When a character you can perceive makes a check to use a celestial implement, if you have a readied celestial implement of your own, you may immediately make a TN 5 Theology check targeting that character to attempt to counter their implement's effects.  If your celestial implement's element matches the counter element of the target's implement, the TN is 2 instead.  <p>Effects: If you succeed, your target's implement is dispelled.  Your target  counts as having failed the check to use it, with a shortfall equal to your ranks in Theology and they do not apply any of its boons to the check.",
