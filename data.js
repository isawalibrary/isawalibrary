	Conditions:{
		Afflicted:"(Core p271)<br><br>Effect: An Afflicted character's Vigilance counts as 1.  When they make a check, after choosing kept dice, the GM may alter one kept <span class='l5r'>d</span> to an <span class='L5R'>O</span> <span class='L5R'>S</span> result.  When an Afflicted character becomes Compromised, one of the following effects occurs based on the ring the character last used for a check.<br><br><span class='L5R'>b</span> Air: The character falls into a melancholic haze of memory, unable to discern the past from the present or the living from the deceased. When the character becomes Compromised, they mistake someone in the scene for a person from their past, accusing them of some half-remembered sin or taunting them over some ancient failure until the end of the scene. <br><br><span class='L5R'>b</span> Water: The character's health collapses and they begin to wither away, wracked by mysterious coughing fits or fevers that resist all medical care. When the character becomes Compromised, they become violently ill and suffer a critical strike with a severity of 5. <br><br><span class='L5R'>b</span> Fire: The character becomes possessed by a desire, pursuing it to their own destruction. When the character becomes Compromised, they also become Enraged (Core p272). <br><br><span class='L5R'>b</span> Earth: The character's flesh becomes pale and begins to show signs of decay. When the character becomes Compromised, reduce their endurance by 1 until the Afflicted condition is removed. This effect is cumulative, and if their endurance reaches 0, the character perishes.<br><br><span class='L5R'>b</span> Void: Ill fortune follows the character's every move, and anything that seems a boon rapidly sours. When the character becomes Compromised, they lose all of their Void points.<br><br>Removal: Rituals such as Cleansing Rite (Core p212) and other abilities can remove the Afflicted condition.  Every two weeks, an Afflicted character must make a TN 4 Fitness or Meditation check using any ring.  If they fail, remove the Afflicted condition and assign the Shadowlands Taint disadvantage to the ring they used for the check (or to another ring if that ring already has it)",
		Bleeding:"(Core p271)<br><br>Effect: While Bleeding, when a character suffers damage from keeping <span class='L5R'>T</span> results on dice, the character suffers the same amount of physical damage ignoring their resistances. Each time wounds inflicted this way cause the character to suffer a critical strike, the severity of the critical strike is treated as being equal to the character&apos,s current fatigue. <br><br>Removal: Any character at range 0-1 of a Bleeding character may make a TN 2 Medicine (Earth) check as a Support action to remove the Bleeding condition.",
		Burning:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: While Burning, after performing an action, the character suffers 3 physical damage ignoring their resistance and 3 <span class='L5R'>T</span>. If wounds inflicted this way cause the character to suffer a critical strike, its severity is 5. <br><br>Removal: A character may attempt to smother the flames with a TN 2 Fitness (Water) check as a Movement and Support action.",
		Compromised:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: A Compromised character cannot keep dice containing <span class='L5R'>T</span> symbols (to a possible minimum of 0 kept dice). While Compromised, a character&apos;s vigilance counts as 1.  <br><br>Removal: A Compromised character removes this condition when their strife is reduced",
		Dazed:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: While Dazed, a character increases the TN of Attack and Scheme action checks by 2. <br><br>Removal: At the end of their turn, if the character did not perform an Attack or Scheme action, remove the Dazed condition.",
		Disorientated:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: While Disoriented, a character increases the TN of Movement and Support action checks by 2<br><br>Removal: At the end of their turn, if the character did not perform a Movement or Support action, they remove the Disoriented condition.",
		Dying:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: While Dying, a character is hovering on the precipice of life and death for a number of rounds (or an amount of narrative time) specified by the effect that applied the Dying condition. Once the allotted time has passed, the character perishes at the end of their next turn (or after completing one task in a narrative scene). If the Dying condition is removed before then, the character stabilizes and narrowly survives their close brush with death. <br><br>Removal: Any character at range 0-1 of a Dying character may make a TN 4 Medicine (Air) check as a Support action to remove the Dying condition.",
		Enraged:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: While Enraged, the character increases the severity of all critical strikes inflicted by and upon the character by 2. The first time an Enraged character kills another character each scene, the Enraged character gains 1 Void point. A character cannot use the rules for Parrying while enraged. <br><br>Removal: An Enraged character may make a TN 3 Meditation (Void) check as a Support action to remove the Enraged condition. Otherwise, the condition is removed at the end of the scene.",
		Exhausted:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: After an Exhausted character performs a check the character gains 1 <span class='L5R'>T</span> and 1 Fatigue. <br><br>Removal: After sleeping for six or more hours.",
		Immobilised:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: While Immobilized, a character cannot perform Movement actions or otherwise reposition them self during their turn, and they cannot select a different stance during their turn. <br><br>Removal: At the end of their turn, if the character did not perform a Movement, they remove the Immobilized condition.",
		Incapacitated:"(Core p272)<br><br>Effect: While Incapacitated, a character cannot perform actions that require checks and cannot defend against damage. If an Incapacitated character suffers a critical strike, they suffer the Unconscious condition in addition to any other effects. <br><br>Removal: The character&apos;s wounds are reduced to a value lower than or equal to their resilience.",
		Intoxicated:"(Core p273)<br><br>Effect: While Intoxicated, a character doubles all <span class='L5R'>T</span> they suffer and doubles all <span class='L5R'>T</span> they remove. <br><br>Removal: At the end of each scene, an Intoxicated character may attempt to sober up by making a TN 3 Fitness (Water) check; if the character succeeds, remove the Intoxicated condition. A downtime scene spent resting also removes the Intoxicated condition automatically.",
		Prone:"(Core p273)<br><br>Effect: The character is flat on the ground, a character may voluntarily become Prone as a Movement action.  A Prone character can move a maximum of 1 range band during their turn.  At the GM's discretion, a Prone character is harder to spot at a distance or hit with ranged attack checks (increasing relevant TNs by 1).<br><br>Removal: At the end of their turn, if the characer did not perform a Movement action, they may remove the Prone condition by standing up.",
		Silenced:"(Core p273)<br><br>Effect: The Silenced character increases the TN of their Intrigue action checks, and checks to activate Invocations, Maho and Shuji by 3<br><br>Removal: At the end of the character's turn, if they did not perform an Intrigue action or make a check requiring speech, remove this condition",
		Unconscious:"(Core p273)<br><br>Effect: An Unconscious character cannot move, perform actions, or otherwise significantly act upon the physical world. An Unconscious character can still make checks to resist effects, but they cannot generally make checks that represent any agency on their part. Increase the severity of any critical strike the character suffers by 10. <br><br>Removal: Any character at range 0-1 of an Unconscious character may make a TN 3 Medicine (Fire) check as a Support action to remove the Unconscious condition. Characters also generally awaken from Unconsciousness after several hours. If a character is Unconscious but not Incapacitated (such as if they are asleep rather than having been knocked out), they can defend against damage as normal, and generally wake up if they suffer harm, hear a loud noise, or otherwise experience something that would normally wake someone.",
		"Lightly Wounded":"(Core p273)<br><br>Effect: A Lightly Wounded character increases the TN of their checks with the affected ring by 1.  If the character suffers the Severely Wounded condition for the same ring, remove this condition.  If the character would suffer the Lightly Wounded condition again for the same ring, they remove it and suffer the Severely Wounded condition for that ring.<br><br>Removal: Any character can provide treatment by making a TN 4 Medicine (Water) check as a downtime activity. If they succeed, the injured character removes Lightly Wounded or reduces Severely Wounded to Lightly Wounded. This check can be attempted once per wounded ring per week.  Additionally, a character can attempt to heal through bed rest. Once per week per wounded ring, a character may make a TN 3 Fitness check using that ring (and ignoring the modifiers to the TN the condition normally applies). If they succeed, they remove the Lightly Wounded condition or reduce the Severely Wounded condition to the Lightly Wounded condition.",
		"Severely Wounded":"(Core p273)<br><br>Effect: A Severely Wounded character increases the TN of their checks with the affected ring by 3.  If the character suffers the Lightly Wounded or Severely Wounded condition for the same ring, they remove it and suffer the effects of a severity 8 critical strike (Permanent Injury, Core p270) for that ring as if they had failed the check to resist it.<br><br>Removal: Any character can provide treatment by making a TN 4 Medicine (Water) check as a downtime activity. If they succeed, the injured character removes Lightly Wounded or reduces Severely Wounded to Lightly Wounded. This check can be attempted once per wounded ring per week.  Additionally, a character can attempt to heal through bed rest. Once per week per wounded ring, a character may make a TN 3 Fitness check using that ring (and ignoring the modifiers to the TN the condition normally applies). If they succeed, they remove the Lightly Wounded condition or reduce the Severely Wounded condition to the Lightly Wounded condition."

"Item qualities":{
		Concealable: "(Core p240)<br><br>Some weapons and armor are easy to hide on one's person, due to size or deliberate design. Unless explicitly worn openly or revealed for use, a Concealable item is assumed to be hidden. <br><br>When observing the wearer of a hidden item, a character must succeed at a TN 3 Design (Air) or Smithing (Air) check to discern that the wearer is armed or armored. If the onlooker succeeds with two or more bonus successes, they also determine the type of the hidden item.  Concealable armor can be worn under loose-fitting clothes, but you can only benefit from the resistance and qualities of one set of armor at a time (Core p238). Concealable weapons can also be drawn more quickly in combat. As part of an Attack action, you may ready or sheathe one Concealable weapon." ,
		Cumbersome:"(Core p240)<br><br>This item is heavy or unwieldy, and impossible to conceal on one&apos;s person. <br><br>While wearing Cumbersome armor, increase the TN of your checks to maneuver in your environment (such as Movement action checks) by 1. If you moved this turn, increase the TN of Attack action checks using a Cumbersome weapon by 1.",
		Damaged:"(Core p240)<br><br>Samurai must carefully maintain their kit in the field, for routine wear and tear will eventually ruin nearly any tool. While many samurai have staff to assist with such matters, most battle-tested samurai have learned at least the basics needed to keep their equipment functional. <br><br>If a weapon or tool becomes Damaged, increase the TN of checks to use it by 1. If armor becomes Damaged, reduce all resistances it provides by 2 (to a minimum of 0). If a Damaged item becomes Damaged again, it loses Damaged and becomes Destroyed instead. If it becomes Destroyed for any other reason, it also loses Damaged.",
		Destroyed:"(Core p240)<br><br>Extreme events or long use without maintenance can shatter, tear, or otherwise render an item nonfunctional. <br><br>Such an item is broken and cannot be used for its intended function. It might still be usable as an improvised weapon or tool, at the GM's discretion.",
		Durable:"(Core p240)<br><br>Items crafted to last can endure damage that would destroy less well-made works. <br><br>If a Durable item would become Damaged, it loses Durable instead. If a Durable item would be Destroyed, it loses Durable and becomes Damaged instead.",
		Forbidden:"(Core p240)<br><br>Rokugani laws are unforgiving, and many things are contraband. This includes many illicit substances, heretical art or literature, and foreign items that have not been transported through strictly regulated trade routes. <br><br>At the end of any scene in which you used a Forbidden item openly in public, you must forfeit 3 glory.",
		Mundane:"(Core p240)<br><br>Mundane items are objects that are found in all contexts of daily life, and are permitted to anyone in most social contexts (within reason). After all, people in many walks of life need tools like knives, walking sticks, and wheat threshers, even if these items can be utilized to deadly effect by someone sufficiently determined. <br><br>Wearing a Mundane item openly has no additional effects, though onlookers still take note of the fact that you are armed if the item could be used as a weapon. " ,
		Prepare:"(Core p240)<br><br>This item must be reloaded, reset, or otherwise prepared after use. After you use this item, you cannot use it again until it has been prepared. <br><br>As a Support action, while it is readied, you may prepare this item for use.",
		"Razor-Edged":"(Core p241)<br><br>Some weapons are particularly sharp, and thus brittle, and must be carefully honed to keep functioning at their best. The traditional Rokugani katana is one such weapon - its keen edge lets it hew off limbs more easily than other swords, but it is also more susceptible to damage if swung carelessly at armored foes. <br><br>When you succeed at an Attack action check that deals damage to a target using a Razor-Edged item, if the damage dealt is reduced to 0 before they defend, this item becomes Damaged. When you make an Attack action check with a Razor-Edged weapon, you may spend <span class='L5R'>O</span> as follows:<br> <br><span class='L5R'>O</span>+: Treat the deadliness of this weapon as 1 higher per <span class='L5R'>O</span> spent this way. " ,
		Resplendent:"(Core p241)<br><br>An item with the Resplendent quality is embellished to attract attention to its presenter or wearer. <br><br>While wearing one or more Resplendent items, if you would be awarded 1 or more glory, you receive that amount of glory plus 1 instead.",
		Sacred:"(Core p241)<br><br>Items with the Sacred quality are imbued with purifying power - often in the form of jade, the mystical stone said to be the tears shed by Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun and protector against the terror of the night. Such items are anathema to the denizens of the Shadowlands and other horrors that prey upon humanity. <br><br>When an Otherworldly being makes an Attack or Intrigue action check targeting the wearer of one or more Sacred items, increase the TN by 1. While you are carrying one or more Sacred items, if you would gain the Afflicted condition, you must choose one of those items to become Damaged instead. Sacred weapons ignore all resistances possessed by Otherworldly and Tainted beings.",
		Snaring:"(Core p241)<br><br>Flexible or, in some cases, harshly curved weapons are excellent for snaring, grabbing, and disarming. <br><br>When performing an Attack action with a Snaring weapon, you may spend <span class='L5R'>O</span> as follows: <br><br><span class='L5R'>O</span>+: One target of the attack with vigilance lower than or equal to the <span class='L5R'>O</span> spent this way suffers the Immobilized condition.",
		Subtle:"(Core p241)<br><br>An item with the Subtle quality is made to not stand out, and people tend to overlook it. <br><br>Increase the TN of checks to ascertain information about the item by 1. At the GM'ss discretion, this also applies to checks to discern what the creator or wearer of the piece intends by presenting it, or to learn anything of value about that person from it.",
		Unholy:" (Core p241)<br><br>Some physical artifacts carry a dreadful miasma. They may have been tainted by direct exposure to the power of the Shadowlands or by foul rituals, but some are made with obsidian, said to be the shed blood of Onnotangu, the god of the moon and ancient foe of the Kami. <br><br>After a character suffers a critical strike from an Unholy weapon, they suffer the Afflicted condition. At the end of each scene in which you use an Unholy item, you suffer the Afflicted condition. Unholy weapons ignore all resistances possessed by Otherworldly beings.",
		Wargear:"(Core p241)<br><br>Implements seen in battle and few other contexts- items with the Wargear quality- are decidedly inappropriate for most social contexts. Wargear makes people nervous, which impedes efforts at diplomacy. <br><br>Whenever another character suffers 1 or more <span class='L5R'>T</span> due to the actions of someone wearing one or more Wargear items, they suffer that amount plus 1 instead."},

	Terrain:{
		Hallowed:"(Core p267)<br><br>Effect: While within Hallowed terrain, a character reduces the TN of Meditation and Theology checks using the specified ring by 1. Tainted beings increase the TN of their checks to resist effects by 1, or 2 if they are using the specified ring.",
		Entangling:"(Core p267)<br><br>Effect: While a character is within Entangling terrain, increase the TN of all checks to move and for Movement actions by 2.",
		Obscuring:"(Core p267)<br><br>Effect: Increase the TN of all Attack checks targeting characters in Obscuring terrain by 1.   A character within Obscuring terrain cannot see beyond range 2 of their current position into the Obscuring terrain (though they can see out of it, if they are within range 2 of an edge). A character outside of Obscuring terrain cannot see into it beyond range 2 of the edge.",
		Imbalanced:"(Core p267)<br><br>Effect: While inside Imbalanced terrain, a character increases the TN of Meditation and Theology checks using the specified ring by 1.  Otherworldly beings decrease the TN of their checks to resist effects by 1, or 2 if they are using the specified ring.",
		Defiled:"(Core p267)<br><br>Effect: At the end of the scene, each character who entered Defiled terrain must make a TN 2 Fitness or Meditation check. Each character who fails suffers the Afflicted (Core, p271) condition for the ring they used for the check.",
		Dangerous:"(Core p267)<br><br>Effect: Whenever a character performs a check while within the Dangerous terrain, the character suffers physical damage equal to the <span class='L5R'>T</span> results on the check."

	"Skirmish Actions":{

	"Skirmish Initiative":" <br><br>During this phase of a skirmish, characters get their bearings, identify their foes, determine their initiative value, and prepare to do battle. For a skirmish, the Initiative check is a <b>TN 1 Tactics</b> check to gain a read on the battlefield conditions and enemy. Remember, characters may spend <span class='l5r'>O</span> from this check to get additional information about their surroundings or undertake small tasks such as readying weapons or diving for cover (Core p328). Characters act in descending order of initiative value for the scene. If two or more characters tie for initiative, the character with the lowest honor acts first, and then the other tied characters act in ascending order of honor.   A character can use any ring for this check. After a character resolves their Initiative check, that character enters the stance matching the ring they used. Each PC participating in a scene should make an Initiative check, as should each sufficiently important NPC (minion NPCs can generate initiative value without a check, using their focus or vigilance attribute).<br><br><b>Determine Initiative Values</b><br> A character's initiative value is based on their state of preparedness when the conflict began.<br> <span class='L5R'>b</span> If the character was ready for the conflict, their base initiative value is their focus attribute. <br><span class='L5R'>b</span> If the character was unprepared (such as when surprised), their base initiative value is their vigilance attribute.<br>Then, if the character succeeded on their Initiative check, they add 1 to their base initiative value, plus an additional amount equal to their bonus successes.<br><br><b>Set Initiative Order</b><br>Organize the characters by their initiative value, highest to lowest, and record this initiative order along with the values. This is the sequence in which the characters act during Phase 2: Take Turns in many conflict types. If two or more characters have the same initiative value, the one with the lowest honor attribute acts first, followed by the others in ascending order of honor",
	Clashes:"(Core p264) <br><br>Even as lesser combatants swirl around them, heroes frequently mark each other out for challenges. A clash is one way to embed a duel in another scene. Clashes can arise from the use of the Challenge action, or via narrative events that lead to a formal duel occurring during another scene (such as an intrigue). <br><br><b>Fighting a clash</b><br>At the end of the round, participants fight one round of a duel using these steps: 1. Staredown: The characters receive strife equal to the round of the clash and bid strife to increase their current initiative. 2. Take Turns: The character with the higher initiative value takes a turn, followed by the one with the lower value (if tied, the one with lower honor acts first). 3. Determine Winner: If a character inflicts the Incapacitated, Unconscious, or Dying condition on their enemy (or kills them) without suffering any of these, they win. Otherwise, the clash is inconclusive.<br><br><b>Finishing Blows</b><br>Like duels, clashes use the rules for Finishing Blows (Core p259) when a character becomes Compromised or unmasks. <br><br><b>Interrupting a clash</b><br>Other characters can interrupt a clash before it begins or during the clash. Using the Challenge action on an enemy involved in a clash allows a character to 'cut in,'' exchanging themself for an ally in a clash. Any other form of interruption requires the character to forfeit 10 honor. Any participant they helped must also forfeit their staked honor. <br><br><b>Extending a clash</b><br>After characters clash inconclusively, they may extend the clash by one round. If both characters choose to continue, they skip their turns in the initiative order and do not take actions until the clash resumes at the end of the next round. If either character chooses to withdraw, the clash ends.",

If your fatigue is greater than half your endurance, you remove 1 fatigue.",
		Challenge:"(Core p263)<br><br>As a Scheme action, you may make a TN 1 Command check to issue a formal combat challenge targeting one character at range 0-5. You must stake 10 honor and 5 glory upon the challenge, which you forfeit if you sabotage the clash. <br><br>Effects: If you succeed, the target must choose whether to accept or decline; resolve one of the following: <br><br><span class='L5R'>b</span> If the target accepts, they stake 10 honor and 5 glory, which they forfeit if they take any Attack or Scheme action before the clash. At the end of the round, the clash begins. <br><br><span class='L5R'>b</span> To decline, the target must forfeit glory equal to your ranks in Command plus your bonus successes.

"Intrigue Actions":{

	"Intrigue Initiative":" <br><br>For an intrigue, the Initiative check is a <b>TN 1 Sentiment</b> check not just to listen, but to politely probe other characters&apos; strengths, weaknesses, and perhaps most importantly, objectives. A character can use any ring for this check. After a character resolves their Initiative check, that character enters the stance matching the ring they used.

If two or more characters have the same initiative value, the one with the lowest honor attribute acts first, followed by the others in ascending order of honor.<br><br>Intrigues are relatively freeflowing scenes, so each character takes one turn when they see fit during each round, rather than at an appointed time based on the initiative order. Initiative values instead come into play when two or more characters wish to act simultaneously, at which point the character with the highest initiative acts first, followed by the character with the next highest initiative, and so on. However, because propriety is vitally important in Rokugan, a character must forfeit 1 honor and 1 glory to preempt one or more characters of higher status in this way (and might suffer further narrative ramifications for doing so, depending on circumstances).",

		"Appeal to a Person or Group":"(Core p255)<br><br>A general social objective that covers many reasons a character would enter an intrigue, this objective signifies that the character is trying to convince someone to behave in a certain way. Often, this objective is directed at a character's lord, in an effort to get the lord to back the character in one of their efforts or take one of their claims seriously. However, it might also be used to get a belligerent party to agree to come to terms, to sway a judge away from (or toward) meting out a punishment, or to win wide support from a large number of people. A character who chooses this objective should state their target at the outset, along with what they want to persuade them to believe or do.<br><br><b>What Does It Take to Complete?</b><br>A character can get someone else to adopt their viewpoint by accumulating a preset number of momentum points on successful Social skill checks against that target. The GM sets the difficulty value to complete this objective (and can tell the players this value, or not, at their discretion). The focus attribute of the target of the Persuade action is a good starting value for this number, but the GM can adjust this value up or down based on factors like stubbornness and the character's innate resistance to the perspective being proposed.<br><br>		<b>What Is Achieved by Completing It?</b><br>At the end of any round in which a character accumulates momentum points equal to or exceeding the difficulty value of the objective, the target is persuaded to adopt their perspective (or stops raising an argument against it). If another character has accumulated a greater number of momentum points at that time, that character persuades the target to adopt their perspective instead. In the case of a tie, the character with the highest status wins. Various circumstances, such as certain ways of unmasking (on the part of the person doing the persuading or the target) or narrative events such as giving grave offense or creating a significant interruptions, can make it impossible to sway someone during the course of an intrigue, in which case this social objective cannot be completed. Additionally, if the target retires from the scene before completion of this social objective (whether or not they have completed a separate personal social objective), this social objective cannot be completed..",

This goes deeper than understanding their target's social objective; it extends to trying to get a measure of their target's character. Beyond quiet observation, this objective requires engaging with a target to draw out their less obvious qualities. A character who chooses this objective should state their target at the outset, along with which features of their target they want to uncover.<br><br><b>What Does It Take to Complete?</b><br>A character can draw out and study someone else's nature by accumulating momentum points equal to or exceeding the difficulty value of the objective on appropriate Social skill checks against that target. A character might also investigate the target with other skills (like Culture or Sentiment) to fulfill this objective. The GM sets the number of momentum points needed to achieve this objective (and can tell the player this value or not, at their discretion). The vigilance attribute of the target is a good starting value for this number, but the GM can adjust this value up or down based on the target's wariness in the situation.<br><br><b>What Is Achieved by Completing It?</b><br></b><br>At the end of any round in which a character accumulates the requisite points, the character learns up to three of the following about their target: social objective, ninjo, giri, composure, endurance, one advantage, one disadvantage.

If the target retires from the scene before completion (after completing their own objective or otherwise), this objective cannot be completed.",

		"Discredit Someone":"(Core p255) <br><br>Provoking one's enemies directly is a dangerous art, but it can put them in positions where they must accept a loss lest their reputation suffer harm. Applying this pressure subtly, without exposing oneself to criticism, is no easy task. A character who chooses this objective should state their target at the outset.<br><br><b>What Does It Take to Complete?</b><br>A character can back someone into a corner by causing them to become Compromised. The character can do this by inflicting strife on the target (or getting others to do so), which in turn is something they can accomplish by using various <span class='l5r'>O</span> (Core p328) and techniques. When the chosen character unmasks, they must forfeit glory equal to their glory rank (as they allow themself to be humiliated or shamed for a moment of vulnerability) unless they retire from the intrigue, and the objective is considered complete. Such provocation makes it very hard to get someone to take the provoker's side in a matter, so if the target's support is vital to a cause, this tactic is usually very ineffective. Further, many samurai respond to this sort of humiliation with a demand for a duel - or with a dagger in the night, if they are of a less-than-honorable persuasion. If the target retires from the scene before completion (after completing their own objective or otherwise), this objective cannot be completed.",

		"Spread a Rumor":"(Core p256) <br><br>Rumors are among the courtier's greatest weapons, and a well-placed rumor can lay the groundwork for future victories. Spies often place rumors in enemy courts as well, to lead foes astray or into cunningly laid traps. A character who chooses this objective should state the rumor they wish to spread at the outset.<br><br><b>What Does It Take to Complete?</b><br>A character can spread a rumor across a group by accumulating momentum points equal to or exceeding the difficulty value of the objective on appropriate Social skill checks. However, no two of those Social skill checks can target the same character, as the rumor must appear to come from multiple sources to be accepted. The GM sets the difficulty value to achieve this objective (and can tell the player this value at their discretion). The vigilance attribute of the character in the scene with the highest status is a good starting point, but the GM can adjust this value up or down based on that character's disposition toward the rumor in question.<br><br><b>What Is Achieved By Completing It?</b><br>At the end of any round in which a character accumulates momentum points equal to or exceeding the difficulty value of the objective, the rumor becomes self-sustaining within the group. This does not necessarily mean that everyone believes it, but they do discuss it, for it is too reputable (or intriguing) to fully ignore. If the character fails at two consecutive checks to spread the rumor, it fails to take root, and this objective cannot be completed in this scene.",

During the staredown, each character receives strife equal to the number of the round (1 strife for the first round, 2 for the second, 3 for the third, and so forth). Additionally, after receiving this strife, each character who is not Compromised may bid additional strife to increase their initiative value for that round. To bid, each participating character secretly chooses a number between 0 and their focus attribute. Then, all simultaneously reveal their number, and each suffers that amount of strife, and adds it to their initiative for the round.",

	"Finishing Blow":" (Core p259)<br><br>As a combatant begins to make a move, a gap sometimes opens in their defenses, giving their foe a chance to end the fight with a well-placed attack. <br><br>The first time their opponent becomes Compromised or unmasks during a duel, a character may immediately execute a finishing blow. This is a special action that can be performed out of turn. <br><br>A character executes the finishing blow by choosing an Attack action and performing it against their opponent, interrupting anything their target is doing (including resolving a check of their own, in which case the finishing blow resolves during Step 6 of the check, after <span class='l5r'>T</span> symbols are resolved but before <span class='l5r'>O</span> is spent). One finishing blow can even interrupt another! <br><br>If the character executing a finishing blow succeeds, instead of dealing damage, the finishing blow inflicts a critical strike with severity equal to two times the deadliness of the weapon or Attack action used, plus the attacker's bonus successes. Any other effects of the Attack action are resolved as usual. <br><br>If two characters trigger finishing blows simultaneously for any reason (such as the mandatory strife gained during the staredown), the one with the lower honor fully executes their finishing blow first, then the other character executes theirs (assuming they are still alive!). If the duel's objective is achieved by the finishing blow, the duel ends immediately. Otherwise, the duel picks up where it left off (including returning to resolving a check, if one was interrupted).",

	"For the student to become a sage, he himself must make the effort. Shinsei is merely a teacher. ",
	"Cut down the whole forest of earthly desire, not just one tree only. ",
	"'Here I shall dwell in the winter and summer, here I shall dwell in the rain' - so the fool thinks, but does not think of death. ",
	"If by leaving a small pleasure one sees a great pleasure, the wise man will leave the small pleasures to look at the great. ",
