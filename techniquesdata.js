This effect persists until the end of your next turn, or until any target performs an Attack action. <p> New Opportunities <p> Air <span class='l5r'>O</span>+ (Mass Battle): If you succeed, if an enemy army has one or more cohorts within the terrain, it receives 1 panic per <span class='l5r'>O</span> spent this way. Air <span class='l5r'>O</span>+ (Other Scene): If you succeed, each character you d id not target who is within the terrain receives 1 strife per* spent this way. Air <span class='l5r'>O</span> <span class='l5r'>O</span> <span class='l5r'>O</span>: If you failed, increase the TN of Attack action checks targeting each of your targets by 2.

fluff: "While Leadership counsels against the needless destruction of the enemy's assets-for these can become ones own assets if seized-sometimes fire provides an avenue that subtler means could not. Baggage trains, fortifications, or even the tents of the wounded-for dishonorable commanders, any of these can make tempting targets for the flame. ",
effect: "Activation: Once per game session as an Attack and Movement action during a mass battle, you may make a Skulduggery (Fire) check targeting one enemy leader's cohort. The TN is equal to the vigilance of that cohort's leader. You may expend 1 charge of blasting powder and forfeit honor equal to half your honor rank (rounded up) to reduce the TN by 2 (to a minimum of 1 ). <p> Effects: If you succeed, you achieve one of the following: <br> <span class='l5r'>p</span> Reduce the difficulty value of a fortification the target is occupying by 4 plus your bonus successes. If this reduces the difficulty value to 0 or lower, the fortification is destroyed; any army with a cohort occupying it receives attrition equal to your bonus successes, and any leader or commander inside suffers a critical strike severity equal to 6 plus your bonus successes. <br> <span class='l5r'>p</span> Remove the Confining and Entangling terrain quality from a fortification the target cohort occupies, but add the Dangerous and Obscuring terrain qualities to that area as it catches ablaze. <br> <span class='l5r'>p</span> Remove one cohort ability from the target cohort. This ability is restored when the army resupplies (such as when making a maintenance check, as described on page 115). Additionally, if you succeed, the target leader must resist with a TN 5 Command check (Air 6, Water 3) or their army suffers panic equal to your ranks in Performance plus their shortfall. <p> New Opportunities <p> Fire <span class='l5r'>O</span>: If you succeed, the target cohort's leader suffers a critical strike with severity equal to equal to 6 plus your bonus successes. <br> Fire <span class='l5r'>O</span> <span class='l5r'>O</span>: The target cohort's leader suffers the Dazed condition. <br> Fire <span class='l5r'>O</span>+: If you succeed, you may expend a number of additional charges of blasting powder up to spent this way to add two bonus successes expended this way.
