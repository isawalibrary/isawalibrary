<br>Crane Wedding - Kakita Shimizu's spotlight episode
<br>&nbsp; 1.Arrival at the Wedding
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Key Scenes: Meeting the shugenjas and duelists before arrival 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrival, meeting the groom
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Amusements in the garden, meet the other Clan representatives, meet one of the ghosts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner, gift giving.  The Crab gives a brace of fighty boar for hunting.  The Dragon and/or the Phoenix give a blessing. The Scorpion gives a katana.  The Mantis gives a falcon, knowing the Bride's penchant for falconry.  The Unicorn gives a gelded destrier.  Lady Asami, on behalf of the Crane clan gifts the town to the Lion. Uncle Shigehisa gives an illustrated special edition geneology.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Altai Saker is the bleeding edge of top of the range falconry birds.  Reaching a top speed of 120m per second within 5 seconds of a standing start - you will know that is an improvement of 11% over the Amur falcon - the Altai Saker can bring down prey of upwards of 2kg.  The Altai Saker will, within 5 years, be the new standard for falconry within the Empire, but for now- the best part- this splendid specimen is one of only seven in Rokugan."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;First night, awoken by Lady Asami, the duelists have been found dead.  Their coats and daisho are left off to the side by a tea set.  They did not use techniques from their own schools.  One used a very skilled Iaijutsu cut, the other used a Heartpiercing Strike.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Morning, Lady Asami is meeting with Kitsu Shigehisa, he wants to call the wedding off but she is adamant that is a bad idea.  She asks him to tell her about what the problem is, exactly.  The meeting is broken off as a servant passes by, shouting that the boars have broken free and the hunt has been moved up in the day's schedule.

The Secret of the Azusa Bow
 
The trick is to not aim.  Aiming is a delusion.  The arrow knows where it needs to go.  Archery is merely the art of letting go.

General Knowledge: Sanpuku Seido and the Kaito 
 
The main roads in the area are safe, patrolled, and maintained – but there have been Yobanjin attacks on more out of the way routes.  All visitors to the region, especially in winter, are advised to stay safe and stick to well-travelled routes.  

The Kaito's duty and function is as shrine keepers in the Phoenix lands.  Every important shrine of the Phoenix has at least one Kaito to tend it, keep it sacred, and make sure the spirits are content.  In this way, they are both indispensable and decentralised.

When the Kaito were first elevated to a vassal family they developed the technique of weaving consecrated ropes, shimenawa.  Previously the most common method of consecration was ofuda paper talismans.  Now, there is hardly a sacred place in all of Rokugan which is not wrapped with shimenawa ropes.

Their bloodline is few in number but is known for being particularly close with the spirits, and some amongst them can become vessels for the kami without being shugenja.  Similar to the Isawa, they have a high incidence of shugenja-capable children born to them.

The Kaito are known for having many idiosyncratic traditions and techniques, including archery divination, a unique dialect, cuisine, and their own musical tradition.  Although they are vegetarian day to day, as the great majority of Phoenix are, they have some ritual dishes with venison and bear which are eaten only during certain festivals.

Although all of the other Phoenix families are vassals to the Isawas to some extent, the Kaito enjoy unique autonomy to the extent that even the Asako grumble over it on occasion.  Even when they were literally Isawa vassals, as long as they fulfilled their function, they were allowed to do whatever.  It was something to do with the wording in the pronouncement where they were made a vassal family in the first place.  Due to the Phoenix being hit hard in the Clan War, the Kaito were promoted to a full main line family so they could be used as marriage alliance fodder.

The Kaito, originally from the Isawa family, tend to have a particular look to them.  The typical Isawa look is quite bony in the face, they tend to have brownish hair and a haughty bearing, but the Kaito are predominantly soft-featured, black hair, and many of them have greyish eyes uncommon in the Empire.

There is a Kaito dialect, with many idiosyncratic words, although because the Kaito are very spread out, when they serve in shrines and temples throughout Phoenix lands or further afield, they speak standard Rokugani to be understood.

Hook:
 
A PC has family near Sanpuku Seido shrine.  Recently s/he received a letter from the family member asking her to come to Sanpuku Seido for the Iomante festival.  The tone of the letter is a bit weird, foreboding and somber and desperate, though the subject matter of meeting up to enjoy a local festival is lighthearted enough
 
Approaching the location:
 
The journey to Sanpuku Seido takes you along a road through the mountainous northern territory of the Phoenix lands.  The road is well travelled, it is on some popular pilgrimage routes as the shrine itself is a place of some fame, and the roadside stops are comfortable if a bit sparsely furnished and the food is plainer and more humble than you are used to.  It’s mostly geared towards Phoenix and tourists who want the Phoenix experience, so it is vegetarian fare cooked with the philosophy of tastelessness being next to godliness.  In the final stretch, the road shrinks to a steep and winding path wide enough only to walk single file, worn stone steps bowed in the middle from centuries of devotee’s feet.  A village bustles up here in the thin high-altitude air: the shrine keepers and servants make their homes here, hewn into the mountainside.  A rickety-looking rope bridge sways across a 100m gap, and first time visitors often have to reassure themselves that the Kaito are known for their rope-weaving before crossing from the gatehouse to the shrine itself.
 
It is the Feast of Iomante, the Bear Festival.  It is a regional festival, you see many Kaito children running and chasing each other with their faces and hands painted up with blue markings for the event, wearing straw bear cloaks, while brightly coloured stalls with grilled skewers of tender, spiced ‘forest duck’ give off delicious, exotic aromas.  The Bear Festival isn’t much known about outside of Phoenix lands, and even there only really known about as ‘a thing that Kaito like to do’ - it's a bit too off-brand to appeal to the tourists.  As such, while the shrine might be packed with tourists and pilgrims at more widely observed occasions, the vast majority of people you can see here are Kaito.  Almost every shrine in Phoenix lands worth praying at has at least one Kaito there to keep the consecrations and make sure the spirits are content, so as a family they are very decentralised, so perhaps that’s one reason why there are festivals like this one that take place in five or six main locations across Phoenix lands– to bring the Kaito back together once in a while.  There is another summer festival which is unique to the Kaito.
 
The Bear Festival:
 
Children like it, they like getting the face paint, and running around pretending to be bears.  There’s a big archery show, gives young people a chance to have a bit of friendly competition and the old timers a chance to show them how it’s done.  The food – forest duck is delicious, if you don’t think too long about it – and we only get the excuse to eat it once a year or so.  Everyone gets a few days off, or a few days off in lieu.  Everyone likes it.  
 
The forest duck is the meat of a hibernating bear.  Hard to get hold of in some areas, so they tend to make do with pork or goat – but in the village by Sanpuku Seido they do it the old way.  Of course, consuming animal flesh invites impurity and is generally a bit gross, so there is a ritual cleansing on the next day after the festival.
 
The Shrine History and Hero:
 
A secluded shrine at the very northern edge of Phoenix lands, and the Empire.
It is not a large shrine but it is a site of particular significance to the Kaito family, as it marks the site of the family's founder's victory against a rampaging oni in the fifth century.  In honour of her valor, Isawa Kaito and her household were raised to a vassal family.  Kaito herself is enshrined here as a honoured ancestor.
 
It is the end of the Iomante Bear Festival
 
The last day has an archery competition.  They’re doing it in the village square now, as the shrine itself is closed to the public.  The winner gets to ring the bell.  They are finishing off the rest of the forest duck afterwards and enjoying some sake.  There will be a mass blessing tomorrow.
 
Speaking to the remaining family member
 
Kaito Itsuki is a 16 year old boy, who just passed his shufuku around three or four months ago.  (The Kaito dialect word for ‘gempukku’)  He had not performed amazingly so he was assigned to shrine sweeping and maintenance.  A few years of such service often has the positive effect on focusing a young mind.  He had taken to rising earlier and earlier in order to accomplish his tasks but one morning he didn’t show up at the shrine.  His family thought he had a girlfriend.  Since his disappearance, some have been saying he was probably taken and eaten by Yobanjin, others that he was spirited away by unusual spirits, others that he must have fallen off the rope bridge.
 
Speaking to the Kaito family daimyo 
 
Kaito Nobukai is in his 60s, humble and folksy and down to earth on first meeting.  He tries to persuade the non-Kaito PCs to leave after the festival.  The shrine is closed due to maintenance.  
If the PCs insist, Nobukai becomes steely under a veneer of folksiness.  This is a Kaito matter, which will be handled by the Kaito, no need to involve outsiders, no need to kick up a fuss.
He looks sad when the PC mentions Itsuki, says “He’s a good boy, diligent, serious about his duties.  I am sure he will be found soon and safely.”
 
Next Day:
 
The morning is sounded by the ringing of the shrine bell.  
There is a purification blessing being held in the shrine.  Although the shrine has been closed to visitors for the past month, they are allowed in for the purification.  The samurai are blessed first, the Kaito Daimyo is lead ritualist in the ceremony.  The peasants will be blessed afterwards.  
 
There is a song at the end of the blessing.  It looks like all the Kaito present know it.  
 
At the end of the song, there is a sharp cracking sound, then a scream.  One of the wooden railings at the cliff’s edge is splintered and broken.  Next to the broken railing is a child’s ball.  A woman is on her knees, looking over the cliff's edge, shrieking and shrieking.  
 
The peasant ceremony takes place in the town square not the shrine.  It is a subdued affair.
 
Upon investigation, the wooden railing looks far sturdier than a child could break, or a child’s weight would break.
 
Visiting the Shrine
 
A stream of clear spring water flows from a crack in the rocks into a basin, which pilgrims and visitors clean their hands and face with, before crossing beneath a large torii gate strung with sacred shimenawa rope.  As you approach, you see a giant centipede scuttle down the side of the torii to disappear into the grass.  Beyond lies the shrine grounds proper.  There is a zen garden with a large birchwood tree at its centre, more sacred rope strung around it.  Beyond that, half sunken back into the stone cliff, lies the honden – the most sacred part of the shrine where relics and treasures are kept.
 
The shrine is subdued, the only sounds are singing and the rhythmic sound of sweeping.
 
Kosori is a junior shrine keeper and dogsbody.  She projects a breezy, unconcerned air though she has a wariness and guardedness about her she tries to conceal.  The room you find her in is clearly half-swept.  The unfinished side of the room has a thick layer of dust on the floorboards and the rafters above are clotted with cobwebs.  “Let’s just say we have some very hardworking spiders.  But – spiders in a shrine are supposed to bring good luck, so I can’t complain too much.”   “Oh- you shouldn’t be here, how embarrassing, the room isn’t in a fit state”  The shimenawa hanging from the rafters has a tuft of fraying straw from it – when it is pointed out, Kosori goes pale, and fishes some talisman charms from her obi, then affixes it with care to the frayed part, murmuring a prayer as she does.  
 
If asked about Itsuki, she looks afraid.  “I don’t know.  I don’t know where he is.  He's been missing, and they sent out scouts to look for him, but if they haven't found him by now...”
 
If speaking with the daimyo or the priestess, they talk about replacing the shimenawa and even rebuilding the shrine using new materials – if we could get someone to put in a good word with the elemental council to approve the expense.  The blessing ropes date back to the founding of the shrine, and they were blessed by an Elemental Master – the kami here have got used to them and nothing less will do now.  As I say, we are making the best of it.
 
From the honden there are whispers audible, as if there are two people in hushed argument.  It is forbidden to enter, only the kannushi or the family daimyo are to enter the consecrated space.  The sliding paper screen door is secured with frayed ropes, and on close inspection, it is clear that these are not blessing ropes as would be expected, but ropes of binding.  Where blessing ropes are used to build homes for the mikokami to inhabit, binding ropes are used for prisons… to confine altogether darker beings.
 

 
The next day
 
Kosori is cleaning the same room.  There is a thick layer of dust over the unswept part of the room, and cobwebs have clotted the rafters.  A millipede scuttles up one wall.  If asked about it, she looks afraid, “It’s like this every day.  I sweep it, the dust and cobwebs come back within hours.  The shimenawa are all fraying, yesterday – that tear you found – it must have happened since I checked them in the morning.  It used to be me and Itsuki clearing it each day, now it’s just me.”  “I spoke to the priests, they said that I was making excuses for not fulfilling my duties properly, or that I was just stirring up trouble, being a complainer.  When Itsuki came, he noticed it too – it’s impossible not to, right?  But it was such a relief, that someone else was acting like it wasn’t absolutely normal.  We started coming in early, to get the worst of it fixed before the shrine opened.”  About Itsuki’s disappearance, she says “I woke up late that day.  I didn’t come in until well after sunrise.  The place was half swept already, Itsuki must have come in, but nobody saw him that day or since.  I went to the daimyo.  I thought, I thought the daimyo would make it all ok again.  He told me to stop talking about it.  Not to worry about Itsuki.  That the best thing I could do to help was to carry on doing my best at the shrine.”  If pressed, she adds “At first I thought he didn‘t believe me, but he’s been visiting the shrine at night, praying and reconsecrating, replacing ofuda, applying new wards.  But it isn’t enough.  Even he, isn’t enough.  The decay is accelerating, day by day it worsens.”
 
 
Enter the inner chamber, attracted by whispers
 
Find a ritual dagger?
 
Kaito Nobukai and his guys show up along with Maezawa
 
People draw steel, and the consecration is broken, ghosts flood out of the well and they start eating Nobukai’s guys, Nobukai is wounded.  
 
Go look for Maezawa, find him on the other side of the rope bridge, he cuts the rope bridge.  No other way across, this place was built to imprison the Ateru and the chasm is a line of defense.  Although she has no feet she must nonetheless walk – that is part of her curse.
Although most ghosts are punished by their own sins, an Onryo exists to punish the living.
 
Onryo are beings of extreme emotion.  Hatred, vengeance, and grudges.  Their hunger for slaughter offends the kami, who flee for more harmonious places.
 
I have lost track of the years I have waited for this moment.  It must be decades by now.  Thirty, forty years.  If I have to cleave this mountain to dust, I will see Itakshir’s traitor children utterly eradicated.
 
You faithless dogs.  Go then, I don’t need you.  I’ll find more, there is no end to those the Isawas have wronged over the years.  I am no longer bound to this place.
 
 
The family member is the first samurai who has gone missing but there have been eight disappearances in total.  The others were peasants, some of them were pilgrims, so it was harder to notice they were missing.
There is a disturbance in the kami of the area, Unbalanced terrain.  When the keepers sweep the shrine, dust seems to resettle to coat the surfaces anew, the shimenawa are found frayed and damaged and must be patched, spiders make cobwebs in the rafters, it is harder and harder to keep the shrine in a consecrated condition.
 
 
Itakshir and Ateru were priestesses, leaders of the Hyoketsu yobanjin mountain tribe.  
They had seen similar tribes destroyed by the Empire.
The Phoenix didn't want to destroy the Hyoketsu.  The yobanjin had secret techniques which they guarded jealously - or they were aware that if the Phoenix were to get hold of these secret techniques, they would not hesitate to wipe out the Hyoketsu the next time they raided the Empire's lands.  For as long as they held this old wisdom hostage, they were safe.  When Hyoketsu were captured, the Isawas tried to bribe, torture, otherwise persuade them to cough up how they did their sacred archery and divinations, but they knew that to give up their secrets would seal their deaths and the deaths of their entire people - so they chose to keep their secrets to the grave.
The Hyoketsu were down to fewer than 150 people.  
In the grip of a winter famine, Itakshir and Isawa Hisoki forged an accord.  Dealing with yobanjin was illegal, so Itakshir took the name Isawa Kaito and wore the Phoenix mon in order to save her people.
 
 
A painted screen in the shrine's honden shows a depiction of Isawa Kaito's battle.  A woman in shrine keeper's garb is shown leaping up, holding a curved bow with a shining arrow nocked, ready to loose it at a demon swathed in ragged fur with the face of a horned skull.
The curved bow in the shrine is not quite a nemuranai but in some generations may be.  The ancient bow is wrapped in consecrated ribbon, over its birchwood and bone core.  The bow recognises its wielder, and if any other tries to string it, the bow twists in their hands and breaks the string.  
 
The shrine's shimenawa are not blessing ropes, but binding ropes.  These make not dwellings for the kami, but prisons.
The Kaito are covering up the missing persons, the degredation of the shrine, because they value their autonomy and don't want to admit they can't keep order in their own house.  This is after all the remit of the Kaito family, their function, to admit they cannot keep one of their most sacred shrines holy and go begging to the Isawas or the Asako for help, would be an intolerable humiliation.
The wards have been failing for a year now.  The daimyo has been coming to the shrine at night, replacing the prayer papers, reconsecrating, bolstering the wards with prayer.
Isawa Kaito defeated the ateru, and gave her life to bind it to the well, and that is what is at the heart of this shrine.
