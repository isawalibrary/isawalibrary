Because penanggalan thrive on secrecy, one is unlikely to attack a party of samurai unless it can arrange for one of them to be alone and takes them by surprise.

It speaks to him with great fondness, and their endless conversations draw many eyes (and lead some to believe he is a little odd). Determined, knowledgeable, and only mildly off-putting (for a Kuni, anyway), Kayo secretly yearns for greater things, but he could never abandon his duty or the kodama that has befriended him. <br>Unmarried and with no heirs, Kayo wishes for a betrothal, but his poor luck and obscure duty work against him, and he is at a loss regarding what to do.

It is almost as if it does not wish for Kayo to marry lest his attentions be drawn elsewhere, but surely it is not responsible for his poor marital luck...",

qualities:"The Mantis consider Manami one of their best pirates, but she hates her reputation and that of her clan, wishing she could be seen as a legitimate samurai. Torn between three impulses - to live a simple life of fishing and seafaring, to provide for her family and clan with continued raids, and to obtain the recognition and respect of the other clans - Manami leads her crew with a shrewd grumpiness. She chooses a single wealthy target over several smaller, easier ones to avoid as much bloodshed as possible. If she is challenged on a decision, she solves the disciplinary problem with some grappling, and her short, stocky, powerful body quickly proves her physical might. Her successful piracy count demonstrates her significant tactical insight. When the tsunami hit Crane lands, instead of picking at the corpses and villages like carrion, Manami rescued several survivors. Informing her sailors that the Crane may pay a ransom for their people, she has treated these outsiders well, integrating them at a village near Toshi no Inazuma. This scheme has not paid off and may be an unflattering mark on her record, but her sailors remain loyal and well fed from their work, so they don't complain. The Mantis Clan, however, has mixed feelings about this act of mercy, and especially about taking on responsibility for people loyal to the Crane; some doubt her dedication to piracy and to the Mantis. Those jealous of her success and popularity continually bring up this softening in her heart. What they truly fear is her ambition. She has openly discussed sending tribute and representatives to Otosan Uchi to turn the Mantis into a Major Clan. With each successful raid, the possibility becomes more real, with her name on top of the list to represent the Mantis.",

Wretched cruelties befell people around her in service of nothing more than petty human ambition, and she grew to believe Rokugan's ruling caste was incurably corrupt - and that the founding Kami had forsaken their followers. Her desire became nothing less than to sweep the table clean. She stole a Black Scroll from the Yogo family and journeyed into the Shadowlands. There, she used the unspeakable knowledge within the scroll to become a twisted, demonic conduit.

Mazoku serve a vital role as magistrates and guards within Gaki-do, but the sheer number of spirits there utterly overwhelms any attempt to properly keep them contained. Many gaki escape Gakido to haunt Rokugan, especially in areas where the two realms draw near, such as where violent battles, terrible murders, and other blood-soaked horrors occurred. Hunting down and returning these troublesome spirits to Gaki-do is nearly impossible for the mazoku, which is why they sometimes work with Phantom Hunters to jointly accomplish their common mission.",

This habit has not won her any friends, and it has soured her relationship with Ichiro to the point of turning these once-close friends into enemies. Reo is lean and muscular but clumsy. As she has nothing to mark her rank, she ensures that everyone remembers her position by mentioning it often. She wears a club at her side and rests her hand on it as though it were a sword. She seems to take pleasure from criticizing Ichiro in particular. She likes Kaiya more than she'll admit, but she is afraid of her father, Hitoro.

She left the village and set up the way station with her husband, but he was from Hirosaka, and the villagers disapproved of her marrying outside the village. This is partly because Setsuo, who had only recently been made leader, was in love with her. Setsuo now maintains that she used her knowledge of herbs to force him to love her before abandoning him, but whether that's true or not only she knows. Otoha is a mature but attractive woman - also something villagers attribute to her knowledge of herbs - with sharp eyes and a sharper wit. She has an unnerving way of welcoming visitors to the way station as though she already knows them, and she can usually guess what items they would be interested in. She wears bright-colored clothes that are finely made and embroidered as a display of her prosperity. Although she is happy to talk about her husband's mercantile savvy and obviously has fond memories of his drinking songs, she won't discuss his death. No one knows how he died or what happened to his body.

However, he is a practical man, one whose fortunes rise and fall erratically, and he comforts himself with the thought that next month he might be sleeping in far grander accommodations. Haru's ambition and confidence are both his greatest assets and his most terrible flaws. He can skillfully impersonate a high-ranking courtier flawlessly for weeks and be treated like an honored guest by a host who's too embarrassed to admit they can't remember their distant cousin. Then, he'll grow overconfident and make a mistake, such as claiming knowledge or a skill he lacks, prostrating himself before someone of inferior rank, or seducing his host's spouse. He managed to do all three recently while staying in Hirosaka, and he left on foot with mounted samurai after him. He knew there was a good chance they'd ride through the village and check the forest, but there was little chance they would think to investigate a hinin hut. Haru keeps his true origins a closely guarded secret. He has fabricated so many differing stories in his time there is a good chance he couldn't remember the truth accurately anyway. He is of average height and build, with a pleasant but forgettable face, which he uses to his advantage. His deceptive nature and disregard for the Celestial Order may well offend samurai and possibly the villagers as well. Michi would be intrigued to learn of his existence, however, and may have a suggestion for his next endeavor. The monk might tell Setsuo that Haru should be allowed to go to a monastery but secretly encourage Haru to find and join the Perfect Land Sect, which could put his skills to good use.",
