
-Upcoming

+ Insert the ring symbols into the context tables
+ Input the Shadowlands opps table data - was it too spoilery?  Was that why it wasn't already in?

+ When clicking on the character name in skirmish panel, open the npc libary to the character - no on hover stuff

+ Go over the existing families with Adv/Disadv & Demeanor list.  Some families have far less than others.

+ For function generateData(), row 1013, replace divcontents with something using innerText instead of innerHTML as this will allow tags like <br> to be typed in, add buttons for inserting common tags like the <span class="l5r"></span> tags, make larger textarea boxes for the longer inputs like technique effect.  Maaaybe have the innerHTML display to the right of the text input box as the input is typed into, so you can see how it appears when it is HTMLized.
+ Fixed width website - have the outer div set to centre, left & right overflow hidden, width 1000px or so.
+ Get Random NPC - fully randomised, maybe weight the different groups or ronin will be overrepresented due to large number of options. 
+ Allow saving, loading and deleting multiple skirmish groups - so I can set up a fight with bandits for the start of the session, then another fight for the boss battle at the end 
+ Maybe put Jason Maker somewhere else, I don't like the centred look - if there was a button to autocopy the Jason blob as last step of Jason Making that would be good too
+ Go through all the npc stuff, standardise stuff like enemy qualities (traits?) and make sure multiple abilities in [] display properly 

+ Add advantages and disadvantages and demeanors, favoured weapons, to the new backgrounds, upbringings and schools
+ Go through advs and disadvs for the other clans, families and archetypes
+ Make skill allocation and stat allocation for ronin more similar to the clan samurai (via archetype)
+ make getWeaponStats function to get weapon stats easily
+ Add 'extra advantage' and 'extra disadvantage' in NPC edit
+ Add filter button for 'Add new weapon' for NPC edit (i.e. free text field, weapon category), make the dropdown for selecting the new weapon display "Weapon name (Dmg / Dls)" so it isn't just a dropdown of gibberish
+ Sort pregens, creatures into alphabetical on NPC builder - go through to standardise so that Goblin, Shaman and Goblin, Warrior appear next to each other
+ Add SECRET option in character maker, have it structured as a clan, the different groups can be represented by families, and the different social roles in their society can be schools.  Maybe don't add this yet, so the SECRET are a surprise when they show up in the story.

-Next Overhaul 
+ Standardise some of the very similar advs and disadvs
+ Get rid of the random extra files that are building up in the repository
+ Go through, declare all vars properly to prevent random global var accumulation
+ For the makeSelect etc functions, make it so parameters can be strings or DOM objects.
+ Consolidate the functions for add weapons button from NPC builder and the NPC Edit
+ Full character building - skills not skill groups, title support - don't even know if I want titles to be used at all
+ Standardise all div names, make all function names proper camelCase
