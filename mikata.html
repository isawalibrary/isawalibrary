<p>6 Truths:

<p>1. The party need to go into the Shadowlands because (a relation or loved one of a PC is part of a Crab scouting party which has gone missing / a ronin or peasant a PC needs to find has been lost during a 20 Goblin Winter mission / a criminal they need to bring back alive for information or testimony has fled into the Shadowlands).  

<p>2. A thousand years ago, at the dawn of the empire, Fu Leng cursed the ogres and turned them into animals.  Tainted ogres lose all their reason, ability to communicate, memories, and are seemingly motivated only by territorial aggression, fear or hunger.  This adventure works best if the players have encountered these mindless ogres previously.

<p>3. Recently, due to (the actions of a dark sage or similar miscreant / the activation of an ancient forbidden artifact / the fall of Fu Leng in the Second Day of Thunder / the passage of 1000 years weakening the curse), the curse on the ogres has began to unravel and some ogres have regained their reason and intellect.  In order to remain rational and lower their Taint level, the ogres have resorted to maho (in 4e and previous there was a maho spell to transfer some of a Tainted individual's Taint into a victim - shouldn't be too hard to dream up a similar spell for 5e).  The NPC/s in need of rescue by the party have been captured by the free ogre band, and are to be used for Taint reduction victims.  This puts a time limit on the quest, as if the party don't hurry, the NPCs will be 'used up' one by one.

<p>4. The ogres believe the Crab to be barbarian raiders who send warriors into their lands to hunt their people - not out of understandable reasons such as hunger or survival or self-defense, but for 'glory' or 'status' they can get from returning with trophies of their murders (their interpretation of the 20 Goblin Winter events).  Having lost a loved one personally to the Crab in this way, the leader of the ogres is going to be resistant to diplomacy or bargaining from the party.

<p>5. These ogres are not like their mindless, ravenous counterparts, and use tactical fighting, ambushes, traps, and work as a team.  There are enough of them that a direct assault to free the prisoners would not be successful.  

<p>6. The ogres are also trying to remain hidden from some Shadowlands power (The Obsidian Flower?  Moto Tsume?  Lady Yukiko?  Akuma no Oni?) who wants to re-enslave them.  This could be a factor that the party can use in their favour.

<p>Will the party use stealth to free the prisoners, and need to elude their pursuers as they escort them back to safety?  Will the party use the ogres' fear of being re-enslaved as a bargaining factor?  Will the party return to the Wall for reinforcements and get back to where the prisoners are held before the NPC they want to rescue is used as Taint transfer fodder?  Will the party convince the Crab to set up some sort of alliance / truce with the... um... maho-using, Shadowlands-monster, Crab-kidnapping free ogres...?
