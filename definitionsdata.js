	"Skirmish Initiative":" <p>During this phase of a skirmish, characters get their bearings, identify their foes, determine their initiative value, and prepare to do battle. For a skirmish, the Initiative check is a <b>TN 1 Tactics</b> check to gain a read on the battlefield conditions and enemy. Remember, characters may spend <span class='l5r'>O</span> from this check to get additional information about their surroundings or undertake small tasks such as readying weapons or diving for cover (Core p328). Characters act in descending order of initiative value for the scene. If two or more characters tie for initiative, the character with the lowest honor acts first, and then the other tied characters act in ascending order of honor.   A character can use any ring for this check. After a character resolves their Initiative check, that character enters the stance matching the ring they used. Each PC participating in a scene should make an Initiative check, as should each sufficiently important NPC (minion NPCs can generate initiative value without a check, using their focus or vigilance attribute).<p><b>Determine Initiative Values</b><br> A character's initiative value is based on their state of preparedness when the conflict began.<br> <span class='l5r'>b</span> If the character was ready for the conflict, their base initiative value is their focus attribute. <br><span class='l5r'>b</span> If the character was unprepared (such as when surprised), their base initiative value is their vigilance attribute.<br>Then, if the character succeeded on their Initiative check, they add 1 to their base initiative value, plus an additional amount equal to their bonus successes.<p><b>Set Initiative Order</b><br>Organize the characters by their initiative value, highest to lowest, and record this initiative order along with the values. This is the sequence in which the characters act during Phase 2: Take Turns in many conflict types. If two or more characters have the same initiative value, the one with the lowest honor attribute acts first, followed by the others in ascending order of honor",
	Clashes:"(Core p264) <p>Even as lesser combatants swirl around them, heroes frequently mark each other out for challenges. A clash is one way to embed a duel in another scene. Clashes can arise from the use of the Challenge action, or via narrative events that lead to a formal duel occurring during another scene (such as an intrigue). <p><b>Fighting a clash</b><br>At the end of the round, participants fight one round of a duel using these steps: 1. Staredown: The characters receive strife equal to the round of the clash and bid strife to increase their current initiative. 2. Take Turns: The character with the higher initiative value takes a turn, followed by the one with the lower value (if tied, the one with lower honor acts first). 3. Determine Winner: If a character inflicts the Incapacitated, Unconscious, or Dying condition on their enemy (or kills them) without suffering any of these, they win. Otherwise, the clash is inconclusive.<p><b>Finishing Blows</b><br>Like duels, clashes use the rules for Finishing Blows (Core p259) when a character becomes Compromised or unmasks. <p><b>Interrupting a clash</b><br>Other characters can interrupt a clash before it begins or during the clash. Using the Challenge action on an enemy involved in a clash allows a character to 'cut in,'' exchanging themself for an ally in a clash. Any other form of interruption requires the character to forfeit 10 honor. Any participant they helped must also forfeit their staked honor. <p><b>Extending a clash</b><br>After characters clash inconclusively, they may extend the clash by one round. If both characters choose to continue, they skip their turns in the initiative order and do not take actions until the clash resumes at the end of the next round. If either character chooses to withdraw, the clash ends.",

"Intrigue Actions":{

	"Intrigue Initiative":" <p>For an intrigue, the Initiative check is a <b>TN 1 Sentiment</b> check not just to listen, but to politely probe other characters&apos; strengths, weaknesses, and perhaps most importantly, objectives. A character can use any ring for this check. After a character resolves their Initiative check, that character enters the stance matching the ring they used. Each PC participating in a scene should make an Initiative check, as should each sufficiently important NPC (minion NPCs can generate initiative value without a check, using their focus or vigilance attribute).<p><b>Determine Initiative Values</b><br> A character's initiative value is based on their state of preparedness when the conflict began.<br><span class='l5r'>b</span> If the character was ready for the conflict, their base initiative value is their focus attribute. <br><span class='l5r'>b</span> If the character was unprepared (such as when surprised), their base initiative value is their vigilance attribute.<br>Then, if the character succeeded on their Initiative check, they add 1 to their base initiative value, plus an additional amount equal to their bonus successes.<p><b>Set Initiative Order</b><br>Organize the characters by their initiative value, highest to lowest, and record this initiative order along with the values. This is the sequence in which the characters act during Phase 2: Take Turns in many conflict types. If two or more characters have the same initiative value, the one with the lowest honor attribute acts first, followed by the others in ascending order of honor.<p>Intrigues are relatively freeflowing scenes, so each character takes one turn when they see fit during each round, rather than at an appointed time based on the initiative order. Initiative values instead come into play when two or more characters wish to act simultaneously, at which point the character with the highest initiative acts first, followed by the character with the next highest initiative, and so on. However, because propriety is vitally important in Rokugan, a character must forfeit 1 honor and 1 glory to preempt one or more characters of higher status in this way (and might suffer further narrative ramifications for doing so, depending on circumstances).",

	"//":"",

		"Appeal to a Person or Group":"(Core p255)<p>A general social objective that covers many reasons a character would enter an intrigue, this objective signifies that the character is trying to convince someone to behave in a certain way. Often, this objective is directed at a character's lord, in an effort to get the lord to back the character in one of their efforts or take one of their claims seriously. However, it might also be used to get a belligerent party to agree to come to terms, to sway a judge away from (or toward) meting out a punishment, or to win wide support from a large number of people. A character who chooses this objective should state their target at the outset, along with what they want to persuade them to believe or do.<p><b>What Does It Take to Complete?</b><br>A character can get someone else to adopt their viewpoint by accumulating a preset number of momentum points on successful Social skill checks against that target. The GM sets the difficulty value to complete this objective (and can tell the players this value, or not, at their discretion). The focus attribute of the target of the Persuade action is a good starting value for this number, but the GM can adjust this value up or down based on factors like stubbornness and the character's innate resistance to the perspective being proposed.<p>		<b>What Is Achieved by Completing It?</b><br>At the end of any round in which a character accumulates momentum points equal to or exceeding the difficulty value of the objective, the target is persuaded to adopt their perspective (or stops raising an argument against it). If another character has accumulated a greater number of momentum points at that time, that character persuades the target to adopt their perspective instead. In the case of a tie, the character with the highest status wins. Various circumstances, such as certain ways of unmasking (on the part of the person doing the persuading or the target) or narrative events such as giving grave offense or creating a significant interruptions, can make it impossible to sway someone during the course of an intrigue, in which case this social objective cannot be completed. Additionally, if the target retires from the scene before completion of this social objective (whether or not they have completed a separate personal social objective), this social objective cannot be completed..",

		"Discern Qualities":"(Core p255) <p>Sometimes, information-gathering is a character's main social objective: they seek to ferret out the strengths, weaknesses, or loyalties of another character. This goes deeper than understanding their target's social objective; it extends to trying to get a measure of their target's character. Beyond quiet observation, this objective requires engaging with a target to draw out their less obvious qualities. A character who chooses this objective should state their target at the outset, along with which features of their target they want to uncover.<p><b>What Does It Take to Complete?</b><br>A character can draw out and study someone else's nature by accumulating momentum points equal to or exceeding the difficulty value of the objective on appropriate Social skill checks against that target. A character might also investigate the target with other skills (like Culture or Sentiment) to fulfill this objective. The GM sets the number of momentum points needed to achieve this objective (and can tell the player this value or not, at their discretion). The vigilance attribute of the target is a good starting value for this number, but the GM can adjust this value up or down based on the target's wariness in the situation.<p><b>What Is Achieved by Completing It?</b><br>>At the end of any round in which a character accumulates the requisite points, the character learns up to three of the following about their target: social objective, ninjo, giri, composure, endurance, one advantage, one disadvantage. The same option cannot be selected multiple times this way. If the target retires from the scene before completion (after completing their own objective or otherwise), this objective cannot be completed.",

		"Discredit Someone":"(Core p255) <p>Provoking one's enemies directly is a dangerous art, but it can put them in positions where they must accept a loss lest their reputation suffer harm. Applying this pressure subtly, without exposing oneself to criticism, is no easy task. A character who chooses this objective should state their target at the outset.<p><b>What Does It Take to Complete?</b><br>A character can back someone into a corner by causing them to become Compromised. The character can do this by inflicting strife on the target (or getting others to do so), which in turn is something they can accomplish by using various <span class='l5r'>O</span> (Core p328) and techniques. When the chosen character unmasks, they must forfeit glory equal to their glory rank (as they allow themself to be humiliated or shamed for a moment of vulnerability) unless they retire from the intrigue, and the objective is considered complete. Such provocation makes it very hard to get someone to take the provoker's side in a matter, so if the target's support is vital to a cause, this tactic is usually very ineffective. Further, many samurai respond to this sort of humiliation with a demand for a duel - or with a dagger in the night, if they are of a less-than-honorable persuasion. If the target retires from the scene before completion (after completing their own objective or otherwise), this objective cannot be completed.",

		"Spread a Rumor":"(Core p256) <p>Rumors are among the courtier's greatest weapons, and a well-placed rumor can lay the groundwork for future victories. Spies often place rumors in enemy courts as well, to lead foes astray or into cunningly laid traps. A character who chooses this objective should state the rumor they wish to spread at the outset.<p><b>What Does It Take to Complete?</b><br>A character can spread a rumor across a group by accumulating momentum points equal to or exceeding the difficulty value of the objective on appropriate Social skill checks. However, no two of those Social skill checks can target the same character, as the rumor must appear to come from multiple sources to be accepted. The GM sets the difficulty value to achieve this objective (and can tell the player this value at their discretion). The vigilance attribute of the character in the scene with the highest status is a good starting point, but the GM can adjust this value up or down based on that character's disposition toward the rumor in question.<p><b>What Is Achieved By Completing It?</b><br>At the end of any round in which a character accumulates momentum points equal to or exceeding the difficulty value of the objective, the rumor becomes self-sustaining within the group. This does not necessarily mean that everyone believes it, but they do discuss it, for it is too reputable (or intriguing) to fully ignore. If the character fails at two consecutive checks to spread the rumor, it fails to take root, and this objective cannot be completed in this scene.",

The shugenja schools dedicate considerable resources to safeguarding their secrets, and they crush any who try to steal their sacred lore. At the heart of even the most potent invocation is a simple transaction of faith in exchange for power. A shugenja's offering symbolizes their devotion to the spirits who grant them their incredible abilities. While material offerings might seem odd for spiritual beings, these sacraments are extremely efficacious. A trained shugenja can do without them, but it makes performing the invocation more difficult, as the shugenja's own spirit must bear the burden in place of the offering. <p>A shugenja who makes a material offering alongside an invocation may reroll up to 3 rolled dice showing blank results.

Patience is key when dealing with the kami, lest the kami in turn grow impatient with the shugenja.  The actual act of saying the words, performing the gestures, or undertaking the rites that activate an invocation comes only after a process of attuning oneself to the powers that make the magic possible. Channeling is a way for a character to delay the completion of an invocation, allowing them to carry results over from one check to the next invocation of the same Element.<p><b>Choosing to Channel</b>: When making a check to perform an invocation, after Step 5: Choose Kept Dice, the character may choose to channel any number of kept dice.

This is known as importuning an invocation, and allows characters to perform invocations they could not normally. <p>Once per scene, a character who knows one or more invocation techniques may choose one invocation technique that they have not learned (even if they do not meet the prerequisites) and make an offering to the kami responsible for that power. The offering must be something interesting to the kami and valuable to the character. Whether or not something is sufficiently important is left to the GM's discretion, but generally, the item should at least be rare, if not unique. The item is lost forever as the kami absconds with it. <p>If the GM determines that the kami is satisfied with this offering, the character may perform the action associated with that technique. However, the TN is increased by 1, plus 1 for each school rank by which the prerequisite exceeds the character's current school rank. The character may channel this invocation as usual (see Channeling), but they can only perform the action once."
