qualities:"Descended from the first shrine keeper to tend the Willow- Healing Kami, Kuni Kayo has an obscure and lonely duty. He is the lone caretaker of the Shrine of the Willow- Healing Kami, as were his father, grandmother, and other ancestors before him. Fortunately, he has the kodama of the willow to keep him company. It speaks to him with great fondness, and their endless conversations draw many eyes (and lead some to believe he is a little odd). Determined, knowledgeable, and only mildly off-putting (for a Kuni, anyway), Kayo secretly yearns for greater things, but he could never abandon his duty or the kodama that has befriended him. <br>Unmarried and with no heirs, Kayo wishes for a betrothal, but his poor luck and obscure duty work against him, and he is at a loss regarding what to do. The kodama seems unconcerned, or even jealous, if marriage is brought up in its presence. It is almost as if it does not wish for Kayo to marry lest his attentions be drawn elsewhere, but surely it is not responsible for his poor marital luck…",
abilities:["Jurojin's Balm: As a Support action, Kayo may make a TN 1 Theology (Earth) check targeting one character at range 0-1. If he succeeds, the target reduces the TN of all checks to resist the effects of poison and disease by 2 (to a minimum of 1) and cannot become intoxicated. This lasts until the end of the scene.", "Summon the Willow Kodama: Once per scene as a Support action, Kayo may summon the willow kodama as long as he is within range 0-5 of the Shrine of the Willow-Healing Kami.
